# Simple-Html-Sever-Hoster
This will allow you to host a Gtml sever with php surrport across your network and use it to send files with out a ftp sever for Linux and MacOS maybe? I have not tested at all beacuse I don't own a mac I am saving up to buy one beacuse I really wanna make code for MacOS.
